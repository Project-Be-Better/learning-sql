## 2 - Getting Started With Databases

### 1 - What Is A Database

A **database** is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).

**Key Concepts:**

- **Data**: Raw facts and figures
- **Information**: Processed data that has meaning
- **Database**: Collection of related data organized for easy access
- **DBMS**: Software that manages databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)

**Types of Databases:**

- **Relational Databases**: Store data in tables with rows and columns
- **NoSQL Databases**: Non-relational databases for unstructured data
- **Graph Databases**: Store data as nodes and relationships
- **Document Databases**: Store data as documents (JSON-like)

**Benefits of Databases:**

- Data integrity and consistency
- Concurrent access by multiple users
- Data security and backup
- Efficient data retrieval
- Reduced data redundancy

### 2 - RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)

**RDBMS** is a type of DBMS that stores data in a structured format using rows and columns in tables.

**Key Features:**

- **Tables**: Store data in structured format
- **Rows (Records)**: Individual entries in a table
- **Columns (Fields)**: Attributes or properties of data
- **Primary Key**: Unique identifier for each row
- **Foreign Key**: Links tables together

**ACID Properties:**

- **Atomicity**: Transactions are all-or-nothing
- **Consistency**: Data remains consistent after transactions
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions don't interfere
- **Durability**: Committed changes are permanent

**Popular RDBMS:**

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle Database
- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQLite

### 3 - SQL (Structured Query Language)

**SQL** is a standardized language used to communicate with relational databases.

**SQL Categories:**

#### DDL (Data Definition Language)

Commands that define database structure:

- `CREATE`: Create databases, tables, indexes
- `ALTER`: Modify existing database objects
- `DROP`: Delete databases, tables, indexes
- `TRUNCATE`: Remove all records from a table

#### DML (Data Manipulation Language)

Commands that manipulate data:

- `SELECT`: Retrieve data from tables
- `INSERT`: Add new records
- `UPDATE`: Modify existing records
- `DELETE`: Remove records

#### DCL (Data Control Language)

Commands that control access:

- `GRANT`: Give permissions
- `REVOKE`: Remove permissions

#### TCL (Transaction Control Language)

Commands that manage transactions:

- `COMMIT`: Save changes
- `ROLLBACK`: Undo changes
- `SAVEPOINT`: Set transaction savepoint

**Basic SQL Syntax:**

```sql
-- Select all columns from a table
SELECT * FROM table_name;

-- Select specific columns
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;

-- Filter results
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);

-- Update data
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition;

-- Delete data
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

### 4 - PostgreSQL

**PostgreSQL** is a powerful, open-source relational database management system.

**Key Features:**

- ACID compliant
- Supports advanced data types (JSON, arrays, custom types)
- Extensible with custom functions and operators
- Strong concurrency support
- Cross-platform compatibility

**Advantages:**

- Open source and free
- Highly reliable and stable
- Excellent performance
- Strong community support
- Advanced features (window functions, CTEs, etc.)

**Common PostgreSQL Data Types:**

- `INTEGER`, `BIGINT`: Whole numbers
- `DECIMAL`, `NUMERIC`: Precise decimal numbers
- `VARCHAR(n)`, `TEXT`: Text strings
- `DATE`, `TIME`, `TIMESTAMP`: Date and time values
- `BOOLEAN`: True/false values
- `JSON`, `JSONB`: JSON data

**PostgreSQL Installation:**

1. Download from postgresql.org
2. Run installer
3. Set password for postgres user
4. Configure port (default: 5432)
5. Install pgAdmin for GUI management

### 6 - Quiz

**Self-Assessment Questions:**

1. What is the difference between data and information?
2. What does ACID stand for in database context?
3. Name the four main categories of SQL commands.
4. What is a primary key and why is it important?
5. What are the advantages of using PostgreSQL over other databases?

**Practical Exercises:**

1. Create a simple table with different data types
2. Insert sample data and practice SELECT queries
3. Try basic filtering with WHERE clauses
4. Practice UPDATE and DELETE operations
5. Create relationships between tables using foreign keys

### 7 - SQL Vs NoSQL

**SQL Databases (Relational):**

**Characteristics:**

- Structured data in tables
- ACID compliance
- Predefined schema
- Vertical scaling (scale up)
- Strong consistency

**When to Use SQL:**

- Complex queries and transactions
- Data integrity is critical
- Structured data with clear relationships
- Need for standardized query language

**Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server

**NoSQL Databases (Non-Relational):**

**Types:**

1. **Document**: MongoDB, CouchDB
2. **Key-Value**: Redis, DynamoDB
3. **Column-Family**: Cassandra, HBase
4. **Graph**: Neo4j, Amazon Neptune

**Characteristics:**

- Flexible schema
- Horizontal scaling (scale out)
- Eventually consistent
- Handle unstructured data
- High performance for specific use cases

**When to Use NoSQL:**

- Rapid development with changing requirements
- Handling large volumes of unstructured data
- Need for horizontal scaling
- Real-time web applications

**Comparison Summary:**

| Aspect         | SQL                           | NoSQL                     |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Schema         | Fixed                         | Flexible                  |
| Scaling        | Vertical                      | Horizontal                |
| Transactions   | ACID                          | Eventually Consistent     |
| Query Language | SQL                           | Varies                    |
| Data Structure | Tables                        | Documents/Key-Value/Graph |
| Use Cases      | Complex queries, transactions | Big data, real-time apps  |

**Choosing Between SQL and NoSQL:**

- Consider your data structure
- Evaluate scalability requirements
- Assess consistency needs
- Think about team expertise
- Consider long-term maintenance
